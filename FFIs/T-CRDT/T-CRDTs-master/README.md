# T-CRDT Library

The T-CRDT Library is a Java library which provides T-CRDTs for four basic data types:
+ Register
+ Counter
+ Set
+ Map

A Tunable CRDT (or T-CRDT for short) is a novel type of CRDTs in which programmers can control at the operation level which policy is used to solve concurrency conflicts. The programmer can either choose from one of the multiple pre-defined policies or specify his own.

# WIP

The rest of the documentation is a WIP and will be completed after my master thesis on "Building Tunable CRDTs" is submitted.
